# StardewSync-Mobile

An Android app built with React Native that allows save files from the [Stardew Valley mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley) to be uploaded and downloaded from the cloud with ease. When used with the [desktop version](https://github.com/r-best/StardewSync-Desktop), it allows you to easily transfer your save files from PC to Mobile to play on the go, without needing to plug your phone into your computer and copy the files over yourself.
