# StardewSync-Mobile

An Android app built with React Native that allows save files from the [Stardew Valley mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley) to be uploaded and downloaded from the cloud with ease. When used with the [desktop version](https://github.com/r-best/StardewSync-Desktop), it allows you to easily transfer your save files from PC to Mobile to play on the go, without needing to plug your phone into your computer and copy the files over yourself.

Unfortunately this app is Android-only, I'd love to support iOS but from my understanding of the iOS system, my app would not be allowed to read the Stardew Valley app's data, which means save files. In the future I may make an attempt at it to see if I'm wrong.

> Just to be clear, this is a fan project and I am unaffiliated with ConcernedApe, Chucklefish, or Stardew Valley
